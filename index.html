<!-- exercise info:

The properties you need to add to each element are:

The first element: a black background and white text
The second element: a yellow background
Both elements: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman, with sans-serif as a fallback

Self Check:

Does each element have a unique class name?
Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?
